      <h1>Over 1,400 stores and counting…</h1>

      <p>Jollibee is famous across the world for delicious crispy fried chicken and fast-food classics with a tropical twist. </p>
      <p>  Founded in 1978 by Tony Tan Caktiong in the Philippines, the company was built up from humble ice cream store beginnings, </p>
      <p>  then later on expanded to hot food. Jollibee quickly became the market leader in the Philippines’ </p>
      <p> fast food industry and by 1998, was a globally successful business. </p>
      <p>  The brand continues to be owned by Jollibee Group with over 1,400 locations across Asia, Europe, the US and the UK. </p>

      <br>

      <p>Jollibee serves up the crispiest, juiciest and tastiest fried chicken around, with a diverse menu including chicken burgers, </p>
        <p>hotdogs, fries, desserts and refreshing drinks. Chickenjoy is our signature dish based on the family’s special recipe, </p>
        <p>  hand-breaded in store for extra crispiness. Another favourite is Jolly Spaghetti, made with a Filipino inspired sweet-style sauce, </p>
        <p>loaded with layers of cheese and hot dog slices. These unique dishes have earned the brand a cult following around the globe, </p>
        <p> from Hong Kong to New York and now here in the UK.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Parent company, Jollibee Group, now has over 5,800 stores globally and operates in 33 countries. </p>
          <p>In the U.S., Jollibee Group owns the major food brands Smashburger and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. </p>
          <p> The company also owns the Filipino franchise for Burger King. To this day, Jollibee still outperforms </p>
          <p> both McDonald’s and KFC in the Philippines.</p>
      <br>
        <p>Looking to the future, Jollibee intends to open 120 stores in Malaysia in the next 10 years </p>
